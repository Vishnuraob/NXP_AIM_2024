# NXP_AIM_2024
An autonomous driving system built in Gazebo using ROS. It integrates lane detection, PID-based steering, directional vector computation, and obstacle recognition. The car follows lanes, adjusts steering smoothly, and reacts to obstacles in real time, enabling fully autonomous navigation in a virtual track environment.
